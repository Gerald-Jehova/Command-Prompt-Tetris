The files in the main branch are the only ones necessary to run the game properly. I've even included my leaderboard so that you can compete with me and my friends' scores!
Read the instructions in the game menu to best understand the controls.

Putting tetris.py and piece.py in the same directory and executing tetris.py should run the game properly.

The branch tetris-with-sound includes an alternative tetris python file that includes sound effects. However, this file runs considerably slower because the effects are not ran in parallel.
I've included it just for fun but the original tetris file is superior for now.
